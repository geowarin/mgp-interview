This is useful if you have your app sitting on many domains, and need to have some outgoing e-mails link to one domain, and others to another domain.\r\n\r\nThis works because `ActionMailer::Base` inherits all relevant plumbing from `AbstractController::Base`, but is not documented anywhere. Is it considered private behavior then?\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a single sentence to `ActionMailer::Base`'s doc explaining that usage.\r\n"

This failed due to missing dependencies on `rake db:seed` - added with this PR.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when AR is configured without rails but with custom seed loader. As of the dependency chain in https://github.com/rngtng/rails/blob/add-seed-dependency/activerecord/lib/active_record/railties/databases.rake#L175 `rake db:setup` currently works and loads the seeds via the custom loader correctly. \r\nAlthough, due to the missing dependencies on the seed task itself, it fails when `rake db:seed` is executed on its own. See the stacktrace below, problem is that the (overwritten) `environment` and/or `load_config` task isn't executed and therefore the custom seed loader never configured and therefor evoked. The PR add those missing dependencies explicit. \r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nrake aborted!\r\nNameError: uninitialized constant ActiveRecord::Tasks::DatabaseTasks::Rails\r\n./vendor/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/activerecord-4.2.4/lib/active_record/tasks/database_tasks.rb:79:in `seed_loader'\r\n./vendor/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/activerecord-4.2.4/lib/active_record/tasks/database_tasks.rb:249:in `load_seed'\r\n./vendor/bundle/ruby/2.2.0/gems/activerecord-4.2.4/lib/active_record/railties/databases.rake:183:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'\r\nTasks: TOP => db:seed\r\n(See full trace by running task with --trace)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, an example `Rakefile` looks sth like  this:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nload 'active_record/railties/databases.rake'\r\nRake::Task['db:load_config'].clear\r\nnamespace :db do\r\n  task load_config: :environment do\r\n    ActiveRecord::Tasks::DatabaseTasks.tap do |config|\r\n      config.root = ROOT_PATH\r\n      config.env = ENVIRONMENT\r\n      config.database_configuration = ::ActiveRecord::Base.configurations\r\n      config.db_dir = 'db'\r\n      config.migrations_paths = ['db/migrate', 'other_project/db/migrate']\r\n      config.seed_loader = Object.new\r\n      config.seed_loader.instance_eval do\r\n        def load_seed\r\n          load \"#{ActiveRecord::Tasks::DatabaseTasks.db_dir}/seeds.rb\"\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n    ActiveRecord::Migrator.migrations_paths = ActiveRecord::Tasks::DatabaseTasks.migrations_paths\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n->  `rake db:setup` works using my custom cfg & seeds, although `rake db:seed` failed \r\n"
